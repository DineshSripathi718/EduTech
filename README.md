    ```
    ```json
    {
      "cName" : "Data Analytics",

    ```

## Project Structure
The project follows a layered architecture:

- **Entity Class**: Defines the data model.
- **Controller Class**: Handles HTTP requests.
- **Service Layer**: Contains business logic.
- **DAO Layer**: Manages data access.
- **Wrapper Class**: Encapsulates responses.

## Advantages
- Uses Regex for data validation.
- Open source and free to use.

## Future Scope
- Add functionality to manage trainers and allocate them to courses.
- Implement features to track remaining fees and fetch total number of students.
- Potential to transition to microservices architecture.
